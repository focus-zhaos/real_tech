# 容错 (fault-tolerant) 和共识 (consensus)

两者都是分布式系统的概念，共识算法的目的是为了容错。

容错又分为拜占庭容错(Byzantine fault tolerance, BFT)和非拜占庭容错。BFT可以系统中的某些节点对系统进行恶意破坏的情况下，仍保证系统正常运行。

Or, can we write our own consensus algorithm by our needs mostly to develop an application for a start-up? https://www.quora.com/Are-consensus-algorithms-only-proof-of-work-proof-of-stake-proof-of-elapsed-time-etc-Or-can-we-write-our-own-consensus-algorithm-by-our-needs-mostly-to-develop-an-application-for-a-start-up
